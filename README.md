## Fabrea_salina:
Gene training model for Fabrea salina in Augustus 

## Gene count for orthogroup:
Gene count for orthogroup: Ancestral  evolutionary dynamics have been shown for 33,031 orthogroup in Stentor_coeruleus, Fabera_salina, and their ancestral node (blank meaning no change in terms of gene count for that orthogroup). The right columns also show the gene count in other ciliates.
